**Topic:** Azure Monitor Log Analytics Workspaces for Global Compliance

**Summary:** A global company operating across multiple regions (East US, Central US, North Europe, West Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia) wants to centralize log storage using Azure Monitor. Their goals include minimizing administrative overhead, minimizing costs, meeting regional compliance requirements, and ensuring data sovereignty.

**Key Points:**
- üìå **Summary**
  - Each Azure geography (United States, Europe, Asia Pacific) requires a separate workspace to meet regional compliance and data sovereignty.
- ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**
  - **Correct Answer:** Three workspaces
  - **Reasoning:** Each geography needs its own workspace for compliance and sovereignty.
  - **Why not fewer (e.g., one)?** Would violate compliance and sovereignty requirements.
  - **Why not more (e.g., five or six)?** Increases costs and administrative overhead unnecessarily.

**Topic:** Hybrid Identity Solution: On-premises AD and Microsoft Entra

**Summary:** Recommended authentication method and considerations for integrating on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra.

**Key Points:**
- üîë **Recommended Authentication Method**
  - Use Single Sign-On (SSO) with password hash synchronization.
  - ‚úÖ Seamless authentication from on-premises to Azure services.
  - ‚úÖ Minimizes administrative effort for deployment and maintenance.
- **How It Works**
  - AD stores user passwords as hashes.
  - Microsoft Entra Connect retrieves and re-hashes these passwords.
  - The re-hashed passwords are sent to Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Microsoft Entra ID compares hashes during login to authenticate users.
- ‚ùå **Methods to Avoid**
  - SSO with pass-through authentication: Requires installing an agent on-premises.
  - Federation (with or without password hash sync): Requires deploying and maintaining additional software like AD FS.
